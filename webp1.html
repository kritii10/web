The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it.

The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border.
